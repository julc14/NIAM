# Name It After Me

This is a learning excersise targeting 3 goals:
1. Use .Net 6 Minimal API with mediatr to automatically host the mediatr-defined application use cases at a generated endpoint. This can be nice for Hexagonal/Clean architectures that emphanize application code never living in the presentation layers. In these scenarios controllers often become boiler-plate redirects to the request handler via mediatr. With Net 6 Minimal Apis we can automaticlly generate the endpoint and avoid this.
2. Learn and Improve Blazor skills
3. Learn and Improve Azure Devops skillset
5. Eventually - rebuild the website using typescript + vue.
